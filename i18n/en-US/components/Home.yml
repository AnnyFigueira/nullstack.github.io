    - "The example above uses <a href='/server-functions' class='ci1 p1x'> server functions </a> to read tasks from a JSON file and store them in the <a href='/context' class='ci1 p1x'> context </a> available to all components."
    - "The tasks are listed in a specific <a href='/routes-and-params' class='ci1 p1x'> route </a> that renders a component with multiple <a href='/renderable-components' class='ci1 p1x'> inner components </a> filtered by status with inputs using <a href='/two-way-bindings' class='ci1 p1l'> two-way bindings </a>."
