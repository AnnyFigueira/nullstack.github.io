The **index.js** file at your application root is responsible for starting your application.

When you run the application with `npm start` or `node .production/server.js` the **index** will call the `start` function in your **src/Application.js**.

The `start` function will run only once when your application is booted and is a good place for setting up your [server context](/context).

```jsx
import Nullstack from 'nullstack';
import database from './database';

class Application extends Nullstack {

  static async start(context) {
    context.database = database;
  }

}

export default Application;
```

## Dependency startup pattern

A nice pattern to work with dependencies that require startup time configurations is to define a `start` function in the dependency and call it in the Application `start` function passing the [server context](/context).

```jsx
import Nullstack from 'nullstack';
import Dependency from './Dependency';

class Application extends Nullstack {

  static async start(context) {
    Dependency.start(context);
  }

}

export default Application;
```

> ðŸ”’ Server functions with the name starting with "start" (and optionally followed by an uppercase letter) do not generate an API endpoint to avoid malicious context flooding.
